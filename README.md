# Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles nd such. I modeled the install scripts off of
[this repo](https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix). The actuall config files are
a combination of my stuff and the stuff from that repo.

To copy each of these files to your home directory, type `bin/install`.
